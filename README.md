## Hi there üëã

<p align="center">
  I‚Äôm a Senior Software Engineer with extensive expertise across a wide field of technologies. Ranging from
full stack development with Next.js/React to backend systems in C#, C++ and NodeJS/TS.
  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
I thrive in an environment where I can bring in my biggest value-add, building a high performance team
and facilitate communication across stakeholders. I love a good challenge, and more often, that involves
automating processes in the development or business workflow.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

- ü§ñ I‚Äôm currently working on [building the next generation underwater robot software](https://www.missionrobotics.us)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning AI Agent development and AI/ML in general
- üêã Let me containerize that for you

## Projects 

### RAGTIME ###

Ragtime is a demo for a RAG enabled API.
It allows you to import transcripts of a youtube channel, to then be able to query the data via an LLM.

Ever wanted to talk to your favirote Youtuber? Ragtime can do that.

### Anthropic tool use API demo ###
I wanted to learn how the Anthropic tool use API works to build AI agents - so I [built a demo](https://github.com/codewithpassion/typescript-anthropic-tool-use-example)!
Also, all the examples are in python - so this one is in Typescript.

Check out my [article about it on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/anthropic-tool-api-typescript-dominik-fretz-mgbxe/)!
Or my [video whern writing the code](https://youtu.be/dVuJPvopY18).


### Bone age

Check out this little [ML application](https://github.com/codewithpassion/bone-age) to estiamte the age of someone, based on an x-ray of the hand. 
It's currently based on a human dateset that is available, but the ultimate goal is to run it with Dolphin pec fins for a project with my wife.

### Website

My [personal website](https://www.dominik-fretz.com). It's based on a react frontend with tailwind-css. Hosted on github pages with automated push via workflows.
Check out the [repository](https://github.com/codewithpassion/website).
