## Hi there 👋

<p align="center">
  I’m a Senior Software Engineer with extensive expertise across a wide field of technologies. Ranging from
full stack development with Next.js/React to backend systems in C#, C++ and NodeJS/TS.
  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
I thrive in an environment where I can bring in my biggest value-add, building a high performance team
and facilitate communication across stakeholders. I love a good challenge, and more often, that involves
automating processes in the development or business workflow.
